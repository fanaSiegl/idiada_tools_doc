IDIADA checks
=============

Additional ANSA check can be implemented into ANSA by pyProjectInstaller. In 
order to do so a new ANSA check template should be generated by newPyProject
(check "newPyProject --help" for further details).

.. note::
    ANSA_UserDefined.plist is generated by "ansaChecksPlistUpdater" script.
    It wraps all ANSA check scripts and handles their
    documentation and versions as one single tool.
